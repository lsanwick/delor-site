description: In this program the caregivers focus on the daily needs of the child
  as well as exposing them to the different areas of the classroom. Since most children
  at this age are exploring the world through their senses, many of the activities
  included in the classroom encourage this. We also focus on vocabulary development
  to encourage speech, by naming simple objects in their environment with picture
  cards and objects. Although it is often observed that children are in "parallel
  play" at this age, there are many opportunities for the children to interact with
  one another and encourage social development. Their day also includes art & crafts,
  music time, story time and walks through Serra Park.
